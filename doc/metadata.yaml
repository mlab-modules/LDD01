description: ' Three-channel laser diode pulse regulator module enables the continuous
  wave operation of laser diodesor spike-free switching with defined current pulsesin
  a frequency range of up to 155 MHz. The threechannels can be accumulatively pulsed
  and the peak optical power ofthe laser diode is regulated separately. '
